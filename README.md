# Mixed-Sort-Algorithm
An innovative product of research and analysis, a sorting algorithm that is a combination of insertion sort and bubble sort that performs considerably better than bubble sort (and almost as good as or even slightly better than insertion sort for large input sizes) by taking minimal data comparison, minimal data movements and minimal data insertions in less time complexity.
